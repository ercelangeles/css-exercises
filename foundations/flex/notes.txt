Workflow for css I guess:
- contain elements into their appropriate divs or containers
- organize using justify-content and align-items
- do not immediately resort to stuff outside of flex
- if you still can't get the content to look how you want it to, then use margins, gaps and multiple class uses in css as a last resort.
